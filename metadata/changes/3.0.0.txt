2017-06-28 - 3.0.0

This is a major internal redesign to allow for new features to be added.

Starting with this release, you can now COPY files (as opposed to only MOVE them in the
previous version).

In upcoming releases, you will be able to validate the copy (VALIDATE operation) and
use the completely new GATHER operation.

GATHER consolidates user share folders into a single disk (think for example
when you want to consolidate all the season of a tv show into one disk)

Additionally, a [support fund](https://www.paypal.me/jbrodriguezio) was established, if
you want to show your support to the plugin developer.

These are other changes:
- Prevent spurious rsync lines in logs
- Use system font in UI
- Throttle websocket updates (for dry-run simulations)
- Improve hostname detection in plugin's unRAID settings page
- Bug fixes and improvements
