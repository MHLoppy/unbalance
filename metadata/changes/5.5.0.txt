2019-02-12 - 5.5.0

This is overall a very small release.

There was a bug that prevented Reserved Space to be saved.

Also, rsync error 13 (Errors with program diagnostics) is now also 
flagged so it won't stop the whole operation, you will still need 
to check the logs as for the reasons of the error.

Changes:

- Allow ReservedAmount/ReservedUnit to be saved to disk
- Add error 13 as flagged command
- Core libraries updated
