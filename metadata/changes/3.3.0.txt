GATHER operation is now implemented !!

Consolidate folders from your user shares into a single drive, always checking that enough
space is available for the operation.

Also, as soon as any transfer operation gets underway, a notification is sent showing which
rsync commands will be executed (this happens after you click Move, Copy or Proceed).

Additionally, the following changes were made:
- Verbosity setting controls permission issue logging
- Fix issue with console panel not allowing mouse scroll
- Drive sizes in logs are shown in 'base 1000'
- Update internal components
