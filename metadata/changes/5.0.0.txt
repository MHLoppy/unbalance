2018-02-27 - 5.0.0

This release improves rsync execution handling.

Any rsync command that generates a code 23 error will be flagged and the source files/folders it refers to, will not be deleted.

Use the History page and the log file (/boot/logs/unbalance.log), to check which commands had issues and act accordingly.

Once the issue is solved, you can remove the source files/folders, using the 'rmsrc' button in the History page.

Also, although the rsync default flags are the same (-avPRX), you can now remove the 'X' flag, if you want.

Additional changes:
- Implement /proc based rsync monitoring
- Enable https support
- Fix floating footer issue
- Use date-based version
