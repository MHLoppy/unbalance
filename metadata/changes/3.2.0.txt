VALIDATE operation is now implemented !!

Available after a COPY operation, it performs a checksum copy, thus validating the integrity
of the data.

It works by replacing the rsync flags from

-avPRX (default flags)

to

-rcPRX

If you set custom rsync flags, "-a" MUST still be the first one.

Also note that this operation takes a long time to complete.
