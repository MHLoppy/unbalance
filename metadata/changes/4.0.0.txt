2017-12-05 - 4.0.0

This is major release bringing in new features to improve the end user experience !

### Transfer page
Here you can monitor the progress of a transfer operation (move/copy), broken down by each rsync command that are
taking place

### History page
This is a list of all the operations that have been executed. This allows you to

- Replay the most recent one (excluding dry-runs)
- Validate the latest Scatter copy operation

(both replay and validate need a confirmation before proceeding)

### Other features

- The Scatter and Gather screens are now completely separate, which means you can switch freely among them, without any 
side effects.
- A select/deselect all checkbox was added for the TO column in the Scatter screen.
- The default rsync flags are now fixed, you can only add flags.

### Improvements / Bug fixes

- Fix leaving empty folders behind (Gather operation)
- Fix display of disk location per selection (Gather screen)
- Fix calculation of space bar
- Improve throttling of transfer progress updates
- Avoid running stop script if not present
- Fix enabling/disabling buttons based on selections
- Refactor code to better represent the app's concepts (plan, operation, commands, etc.)
- The size of the bundle was reduced by approximately 70%
